    "\n",
    "## 1. Project Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "Some initial questions to answer that could be explored:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the overall biodiversity across the parks?\n",
    "- Are certain species more concentrated in specific parks?\n",
    "- Are certain categories more endangered than others?\n",
    "- Which parks have the most endangered species?\n",
    "- Which species are most under threat?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Understanding the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two csv files: `species_info.csv` and `observations.csv`.\n",
    "- `species_info.csv` columns: Animal category (eg. mammal), scientific name, common name, and conservation status.\n",
    "- `observations.csv` columns: scientific name, park name, and number of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Types**: all columns are string objects except for the number of observations which are int64.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Size & Quality**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `species_info.csv`: 5,824 rows x 4 columns. Missing values: 5,633 (97%), all in the conservation status column.\n",
    "- `observations.csv`: 23,296 rows x 3 columns. Missing values: 0\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Key Metrics/Analysis Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "- Biodiversity Indexes to consider: Simpsonâ€™s Diversity Index, or Shannon Index to quantify biodiversity.\n",
    "- Trend Analysis: Identify trends between parks.\n",
    "- Visualization: Plan on using visualizations like bar charts, heatmaps, or maps to make the data easier to interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Tools & Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Python Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, for analysis and visualizations. Plotly for interactive map visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "- Jupyter Notebook Report: Clear insights into biodiversity trends, backed by data.\n",
    "- Linkedin Article: A summary of the findings and the importance of biodiversity conservation.\n",
    "- Visualizations: Maps showing species distribution, charts for biodiversity indexes, etc.\n",
    "- Conclusion/Recommendations: Suggest conservation strategies based on the findings."
